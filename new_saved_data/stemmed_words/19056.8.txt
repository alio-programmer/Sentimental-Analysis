difference artificial intelligence machine learning statistic data mining “ data oil ” important trendline 21 st century reason advancement field related data analysis field ai machine learning statistic data mining deal data developing staggering pace field popular buzzword days.buzzwords originated technical term underlying essence fashionable impress main reason misconception people ai ml stats data mining field related analysis data mistook thing word interchangeably convey thing true similarity discipline discipline related analysis data converting data “ information ” .in academic learning ai machine learning statistic data mining academic approach wander technical definition concept underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored case article explain difference primary confusion learner article explains difference explaining philosophy aim discipline wandering technical definitions.the essential difference discipline lie “ aim ” approach achieve aims.the aim artificial intelligence understand intelligent entity satisfy aim understand intelligence make agent intelligent agent answer question found studying intelligent agent intelligent agent found standing front mirror human example intelligent entity 1900s researcher began exploring thought process reasoning process human human being considered ideal intelligent agent mimicking human behavior aim ai initial year research setting goal study experiment began famous experiment conducted initial year achieve aim turing test turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive task sufficient fool interrogator test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence intelligence related working human brain human brain intelligence meaning mimicking human thought process reasoning transformed aim field psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process difference ai understand thought process mimic build collaboration field resulted model neural network mimic function neuron present human brain basically initial aim human-centered human considered ideal intelligent agent.concurrently field computer science developing greater pace advance computer science experiment theory easily tested validated program applied solve real-life problem found computer performed human task complex human example chess-playing program ai program defeated world ’ chess player garry kasparov incident human intelligence ultimate intelligence human defeat ai program lead question human intelligence ideal intelligence computer advanced proved human complex task definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive task problem nature agent researcher began study nature intelligence question test validate intelligence test intelligence solve cognitive problem agent intelligent solve complex problem problem-solving approach easily tested validated computer researcher began studying ideal intelligence selected agent validate experiment computer computer problem-solving approach adopted human-centered approach computer problem-solving approach main aim ai field contributed field giving valuable insights.both aim important collaboratively form main aim ai problem-solving approach big challenge ai overcome order achieve aim solving math problem case intelligence tested problem-solving approach math problem solve problem familiar problem not.consider problem problem familiar mean solve kind problem solved similar problem past question mind solve problem answer solved similar problem past learned past data solve problem haven ’ problem past solve similar problem form intelligence.consider case problem solved kind problem past solve problem consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process kind intelligence.for ai build intelligent agent kind intelligence developed agent reality ai reached point build agent learn past data find information ai today reached point build agent type intelligence.so ai implement type intelligence machine learning domain ai focus solely implementing kind intelligence fact machine learning reason ml called subset ai main difference ai ml.technically speaking “ field study computer ability learn past data find meaningful conclusion pattern explicitly programmed ” statement elaboration essence ml related process “ generalization ” learning past data generalization abstraction common property specific instance formulated general concept claim human recognize daily life object animal easily recognize “ dog ” “ cat ” trivial task wondered mind answer generalization picture dog easily recognize picture dog mind abstracted description dog formulated “ concept ” dog concept learned past experience dog dependent fact thing represented generalized concept minds.with generalization real “ information ” give computer ability generalize “ raw data ” convert “ information ” pattern trend data own.this discipline concern collection organization analysis interpretation presentation data statistic deal data aim explain study explaining data statistic main domain descriptive statistic inferential statistics.descriptive statistic deal explanation description data “ descriptive ” statistic explain information easily large data complex task inferential statistic make accurate inference small data inference task daily life simple case cooking soup completing recipe taste small sample spoonful soup check soup taste good bad depending result sample make inference soup soup good bad similarly statistic case apply inference meaningful information case gather data time-consuming costly case applying inference based sample introduces uncertainty inferential statistic help.so data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistic deal data statistic explain data aim resonate ai ml statistic field correctly interpret data “ data ” raw form example sensor industrial application sensor manufacturing plant sense property temperature pressure raw data generated sensor converted suitable form processed analyzed gather valuable insight solve problem due unique aim capturing essence large datasets gather insight data mining referred “ knowledge discovery ” carly fiorina ceo hewlett-packard “ goal turn data information information insight ” statement completely explains aim data mining difference ai machine learning statistic data mining lie aim approach field fulfilling aim field beauty field
