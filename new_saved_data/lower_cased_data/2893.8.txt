intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when ai-driven chatbots are used with customers, even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers.the availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. this restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. maintaining the security of the customer’s data is also a key challenge.even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function, there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. the chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi-folds by 2040. the optimistic thing about this technology is that ml-based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps “the next big thing” in the customer service domain.
