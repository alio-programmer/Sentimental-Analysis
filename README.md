# Sentimental-Analysis
In this project I web scrapped some articles by BlackCoffers and did a Sentimental analysis on the articles as I have calculated various variables like:
1) Positive and Negative Score
2) Polarity Score
3) Gunning Fog Index
4) Count of Complex words
   
The result of this is stored in myfinalresult.xslx file

For this project I have used following libraries:
1) NLTK library
2) bs4 Library
3) Regex Library
   
All the things in the project from web scraping to stop words removal to lammentization and POS tagging is done in an automated way.
